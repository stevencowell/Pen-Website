  <summary><b>Week 3: Evaluation, Reflection &amp; Continuous Improvement (Advanced)</b></summary>
  <article>
    <h3>Evaluation criteria</h3>
    <p>Professional makers evaluate their work using clear criteria.  <strong>Functionality</strong> – does the pen write reliably and operate smoothly?  <strong>Fit and finish</strong> – are the wooden barrels flush with the hardware, free of scratches and uniformly polished?  <strong>Aesthetics</strong> – are the proportions pleasing and the grain aligned?  <strong>Ergonomics</strong> – does the pen feel comfortable to hold for extended writing?  Makers may also consider durability, innovation, sustainability of materials and how well the finished piece meets the original design brief.</p>
    <h3>Reflecting on the process</h3>
    <p>Reflection is an essential part of craftsmanship.  Documenting challenges and successes helps you identify skills you need to strengthen.  Think about how you prepared your blanks, how comfortable you felt with different tools and whether you controlled the lathe speed and feed rate effectively.  Reflect on your sanding and finishing technique and the care taken during assembly.  Honest self‑assessment reveals patterns that will inform your next project.</p>
    <h3>Troubleshooting and improvements</h3>
    <p>Common issues include misalignment of hardware, gaps between components, tool marks that remain visible after finishing, glue stains, cracks from excessive pressure and mechanism failures.  Each problem has a cause and a fix: use callipers to achieve correct diameters, slow down your feed rate, chamfer tube ends to prevent splitting, remove glue squeeze‑out before it cures, and test the mechanism before final assembly.  Consider how you could redesign your pen for better ergonomics or aesthetics, select more sustainable materials or incorporate user feedback.</p>
    <h3>Looking ahead</h3>
    <p>The skills you have learned extend beyond pen making.  Precision drilling, turning between centres, surface preparation and finishing are valuable in furniture making, joinery and metalwork.  Evaluating your projects teaches you to think critically about design, materials and processes.  As you plan future pieces, consider environmental impact, cost, target users and the story you want your work to tell.</p>
