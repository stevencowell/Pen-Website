  <summary><b>Week 1: Professional Safety &amp; Advanced Lathe Mechanics (Advanced)</b></summary>
  <article>
    <h3>Work health and safety (WHS)</h3>
    <p>Professional woodturners follow strict safety standards to protect themselves and others.  Risk management starts by identifying hazards, assessing how likely they are and what harm they could cause, and then eliminating or controlling them.  Australian WHS legislation requires employers and workers to minimise risk through appropriate training, safe work procedures and protective equipment.  For example, a messy floor is a tripping hazard – good housekeeping is a control.  Dust poses a respiratory hazard – an extraction system and proper masks are controls.</p>
    <h3>Lathe mechanics and tools</h3>
    <p>There are several ways to hold work on the lathe.  <strong>Turning between centres</strong> uses a spur centre at the headstock and a live centre at the tailstock to support the work at both ends.  This method is ideal for long pieces such as pens and spindles and allows you to remove the blank and remount it without losing alignment.  A <strong>chuck or faceplate</strong> secures the work at one end only and is used for bowls or hollow forms.</p>
    <p>Different cutting tools create different finishes.  A <strong>spindle gouge</strong> removes material quickly and is used for roughing and general shaping.  A <strong>skew chisel</strong> can produce a superior finish when used correctly because its long, angled edge slices the fibres cleanly.  Calipers and bushings are used to measure diameters so the turned wood matches the hardware exactly.  Professionals often use dial callipers to achieve tolerances of 0.1 mm or better.</p>
    <h3>Material and safety considerations</h3>
    <p>Wood choice affects the turning experience and final appearance.  Dense hardwoods like walnut or rosewood can be more challenging to cut but polish beautifully.  Soft timbers like pine are easier to shape but dent easily.  Adhesives also matter – cyanoacrylate (CA) glue sets quickly but can become brittle; epoxy and polyurethane glues offer longer working time and stronger bonds.  Professionals avoid wearing gloves at the lathe because material can wrap around the spindle; instead they rely on proper tool technique and PPE such as dust masks, face shields and hearing protection.</p>
