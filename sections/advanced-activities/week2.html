  <summary><b>Week 2: Advanced Turning Techniques &amp; Customisation (Advanced)</b></summary>
  <article>
    <h3>Advanced tool use</h3>
    <p>After you have mastered the basics, you can explore specialised tools.  A <strong>skew chisel</strong> slices along the grain to produce a glass‑like finish straight from the tool but requires careful control to avoid catches.  Carbide insert tools have replaceable tips that stay sharp longer and are easier to control, making them popular for tricky materials like acrylics.  Choose an appropriate lathe speed – slower for larger blanks and brittle materials, faster for small, well‑balanced blanks – and always <em>ride the bevel</em> of the tool to prevent digs.</p>
    <h3>Drilling and gluing options</h3>
    <p>When drilling blanks for tubes, back the drill bit out regularly to clear chips and cool the bit.  Acrylic or resin blanks require slow drilling speeds and frequent clearing to avoid overheating and melting.  Epoxy and polyurethane glues provide stronger bonds and longer open time than CA glue, allowing you to position tubes precisely.  In humid conditions, polyurethane expands slightly and fills gaps.</p>
    <h3>Precision and finishing</h3>
    <p>Calipers are essential for measuring the diameter of your turned pen bodies so they match the bushings.  Some experienced turners use the <em>turn between centres</em> method (TBC) without a mandrel to eliminate flex and achieve better concentricity.  For a high‑gloss, durable finish, many pen makers apply multiple coats of thin CA glue on the lathe, sanding lightly between coats.  This creates a hard, acrylic‑like surface that protects the wood.  Buffing with micromesh pads or polishing compounds can bring out an extra shine.</p>
    <h3>Assembly tips and creativity</h3>
    <p>Before pressing components, chamfer the edges of the brass tubes with a deburring tool or sandpaper to prevent splitting.  Use a dedicated pen press or clamps to apply straight, even pressure.  If the mechanism doesn’t operate smoothly after assembly, gently pull the two halves apart and clear any glue residue from the tube, then press again.  To personalise your pen, experiment with inlays, segmented blanks, resin casting or laser engraving.  Creative designs often require extra planning to keep segments aligned and avoid weak joints.</p>
