  <summary><b>WeekÂ 3: Evaluating Your Pen &amp; Reflecting on the Process</b></summary>
  <article>
    <h3>Assessing quality and function</h3>
    <p>Congratulations on finishing your pen!  This week is about looking critically at what you have made.  A quality pen should write smoothly and feel comfortable to hold.  The wood should be flush with the metal parts with no gaps, the finish should be even and durable, and the mechanism should extend and retract the refill reliably.  If any part feels loose or rough, identify why and plan how to fix it next time.</p>
    <h3>Reflection and improvement</h3>
    <p>Reflection helps you learn from experience.  Think back through each stage of the project: preparing the blanks, turning, sanding, finishing and assembling.  What steps went well?  What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?  Did you achieve the design you imagined at the start?  Consider how you would improve your process or design if you made another pen.  Being honest about problems allows you to grow as a maker.</p>
    <h3>Troubleshooting common issues</h3>
    <p>Common problems include gaps between the wood and hardware, scratches or a dull finish, parts that donâ€™t press together fully, cracks in the timber or a mechanism that doesnâ€™t function.  If the pen doesnâ€™t write, check that the refill is installed correctly.  If the tip doesnâ€™t extend smoothly, the mechanism may be misâ€‘aligned.  A cracked blank usually means too much pressure was used during pressing â€“ in the future press straight and slowly.</p>
    <h3>Sustainability and future projects</h3>
    <p>When choosing materials and finishes for future projects, think about sustainability.  Selecting responsibly sourced timber and durable finishes reduces environmental impact.  Consider experimenting with different woods, shapes and decorative touches to personalise your design.  Each new project is an opportunity to apply what you have learned and to develop your craftsmanship further.</p>
