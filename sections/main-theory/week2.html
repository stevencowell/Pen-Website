  <summary><b>WeekÂ 2: Turning the Pen Blanks &amp; Assembly</b></summary>
  <article>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>In WeekÂ 2 you will turn your pen blanks into a finished pen. The process is broken into three stages: preparing the blanks, turning them on the lathe and assembling the hardware.</p>
    <h3>Preparation â€“ From wood blank to latheâ€‘ready</h3>
    <p>Begin by selecting straightâ€‘grained timber and cutting it to length. Mark a pencil line across the blank before sawing it into two pieces so you can realign the grain later. Drill a hole through the centre of each piece using the size specified in your pen kit, retracting the drill frequently to clear swarf. Scuff the brass tubes with sandpaper, apply glue and insert them into the blanks. Once the glue dries, square the ends so the wood is flush with the tubes.</p>
    <h3>Mounting on the lathe</h3>
    <p>Slide a bushing onto the mandrel, add one pen blank, a centre bushing, the second blank and a final bushing. Tighten the thumb nut gently so everything is snug but not overtightened. Mount the mandrel in the lathe and support the end with the tailstock. Align the grain marks so that the pattern will match when the pen is assembled.</p>
    <h3>Turning â€“ Shaping the pen bodies</h3>
    <p>Turn on the lathe and use a sharp spindle gouge or roughing gouge to round the blanks. Work slowly, holding the tool firmly on the tool rest and taking light cuts. Once round, shape the profile of each blank. A common design is slightly thicker in the middle and flush with the bushings at the ends. Take care not to cut too deeply near the bushings.</p>
    <p>Sand the pen blanks on the lathe, moving through progressively finer grits (e.g.Â 120, 180, 240, 320, 400, 600) until the surface is smooth. Wipe off dust between grits. Apply a finish such as friction polish or wax while the lathe spins slowly, taking care to keep the cloth flat and away from moving parts.</p>
    <h3>Assembly â€“ Putting the pen together</h3>
    <p>Lay out the pen components: the nib (tip), the clip and end cap, the internal mechanism, the ink refill and any decorative rings. Press the nib into one blank, insert the mechanism to the correct depth and test that it actuates the refill. Press the clip onto the other blank. Align the grain and press the two halves together. Finally, test the pen to ensure it operates smoothly.</p>

          <li>
            <p>Why do we draw a line across the wood blank before cutting it into two pieces? <button aria-label="Read question aloud" onclick="event.preventDefault(); speakText(this)" type="button">ðŸ”Š</button></p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q1" value="A" data-correct="true"> To ensure we can realign the grain pattern when assembling the pen so the wood grain looks continuous.</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q1" value="B"> To make drilling easier by following the line.</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q1" value="C"> To measure the length of the pen accurately.</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q1" value="D"> Itâ€™s a tradition that doesnâ€™t serve any real purpose.</label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>When drilling the pen blank for the brass tube, why should you retract the drill bit regularly to clear out swarf? <button aria-label="Read question aloud" onclick="event.preventDefault(); speakText(this)" type="button">ðŸ”Š</button></p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q2" value="A" data-correct="true"> Removing swarf prevents the drill from overheating and keeps the hole straight, reducing the chance of the blank cracking.</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q2" value="B"> Because the drill will cut faster if you stop frequently.</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q2" value="C"> To intentionally make the hole slightly larger.</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q2" value="D"> Thereâ€™s no need â€“ you can drill straight through without stopping.</label>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>What is the purpose of roughening (scuffing) the surface of the brass tubes before gluing them into the wooden blanks? <button aria-label="Read question aloud" onclick="event.preventDefault(); speakText(this)" type="button">ðŸ”Š</button></p>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q3" value="A" data-correct="true"> It creates a better surface for the glue to stick to, resulting in a stronger bond between the tube and wood.</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q3" value="B"> It makes the brass tube shiny and clean.</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q3" value="C"> It helps the tube slide in easier (actually it makes it slightly more resistant until glue is applied).</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q3" value="D"> There is no purpose; itâ€™s just something people do out of habit.</label>

            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q5" value="A" data-correct="true"> Start with a coarse grit and gradually work to finer grits to achieve a smooth finish.</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q5" value="B"> Use only one grit; if the tool work was good you donâ€™t need multiple grits.</label><br/>
            <label><input type="radio" name="main2_q5" value="C"> Press as hard as you can with sandpaper to sand faster.</label><br/>
