  <summary><b>WeekÂ 1: Lathe Setup, Safety &amp; Practice</b></summary>
  <article>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Welcome to the Pen Making unit! In this first week you are introduced to woodturning and learn about workshop safety. Woodturning uses a machine called a lathe to spin wood so you can shape it with cutting tools. Because weâ€™ll be using power tools and sharp instruments, safety is our top priority â€“ a wood workshop can be dangerous if proper procedures arenâ€™t followed.</p>
    <h3>Uses of a wood lathe</h3>
    <p>A wood lathe is a versatile tool used to create round or cylindrical objects from wood. Common projects made by turning between centres include table legs, rolling pins, bowls and pens. In this unit youâ€™ll use the lathe to turn a wooden pen body, but the skills you learn apply to many other projects.</p>
    <h3>Workshop safety</h3>
    <p>Safe workshop practices are essential. Always wear the correct personal protective equipment (PPE) such as safety glasses or goggles, ear protection and a dust mask. Tie back long hair, remove jewellery and keep clothing fitted so nothing gets caught in moving parts. Follow your teacherâ€™s instructions and never use machinery without permission.</p>
    <p>Keep the work area tidy, clean up spills immediately and never run or play in the workshop. Use tools only for their intended purpose and maintain a steady, controlled pace â€“ rushing leads to mistakes. Finally, inspect the lathe and workpiece before switching on: make sure the wood is secured, the tool rest is 2â€“3Â mm from the wood and the speed setting is appropriate.</p>
    <h3>Lathe setup &amp; practice</h3>
    <p>Under supervision you will practise turning on a scrap piece of wood between centres. You will learn how to hold and move a chisel against the tool rest, how to make basic cutting and scraping cuts and how to sand and finish the surface on the lathe. This practice builds your confidence before you start turning your actual pen blank next week.</p>

            <p>Alex drops a heavy tool bag on the workshop floor and immediately starts using a machine without checking with the teacher.
