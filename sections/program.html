<h2>Program Overview</h2>
<p>This Stage 5 Pen Making unit runs for three weeks and covers the fundamental skills of lathe use, pen turning, assembly, evaluation and troubleshooting. Each week builds on the previous to develop both practical ability and theoretical understanding.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Week 1 – Safety &amp; Lathe Basics:</strong> Students learn workshop safety rules and basic lathe operation by practising on scrap timber. They learn about personal protective equipment (PPE), workshop behaviour and how to set up and use a lathe correctly.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 2 – Pen Production:</strong> Students prepare pen blanks by cutting and drilling, insert brass tubes, mount the blanks on a mandrel and turn them to shape. They sand and finish the wood, then assemble the pen hardware to create a working pen.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 3 – Evaluation &amp; Reflection:</strong> Students evaluate their finished pen against design criteria, reflect on what they learnt, troubleshoot any issues and suggest improvements for future projects.</li>
</ol>
<p>This program aligns with Stage 5 Technology Mandatory outcomes and encourages students to develop practical skills, risk management, creative problem solving and self‑reflection.</p>
